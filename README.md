## Inverse Q-Learning for Imitation Learning

This  repository applies the IQ-Learn algorithm to the domain of Autonomous Driving, focusing on the car-following scenario.
The algorithm trains a Deep Q-Network which approximates the implicit reward function contained in the demonstrating drivers behaviour.
We show that IQ-Learn is able to sucessfully recover the driver's reward function.
